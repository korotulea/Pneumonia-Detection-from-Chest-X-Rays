# Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Rays

## Project Overview

Chest X-ray exams are one of the most frequent and cost-effective types of medical imaging examinations. Deriving clinical diagnoses from chest X-rays can be challenging, however, even by skilled radiologists. 

When it comes to pneumonia, chest X-rays are the best available method for diagnosis. More than 1 million adults are hospitalized with pneumonia and around 50,000 die from the disease every
year in the US alone. The high prevalence of pneumonia makes it a good candidate for the development of a deep learning application for two reasons: 1) Data availability in a high enough quantity for training deep learning models for image classification 2) Opportunity for clinical aid by providing higher accuracy image reads of a difficult-to-diagnose disease and/or reduce clinical burnout by performing automated reads of very common scans. 

The diagnosis of pneumonia from chest X-rays is difficult for several reasons: 
1. The appearance of pneumonia in a chest X-ray can be very vague depending on the stage of the infection
2. Pneumonia often overlaps with other diagnoses
3. Pneumonia can mimic benign abnormalities

For these reasons, common methods of diagnostic validation performed in the clinical setting are to obtain sputum cultures to test for the presence of bacteria or viral bodies that cause pneumonia, reading the patient's clinical history and taking their demographic profile into account, and comparing a current image to prior chest X-rays for the same patient if they are available. 

## About the Dataset

The dataset provided to you for this project was curated by the NIH specifically to address the problem of a lack of large x-ray datasets with ground truth labels to be used in the creation of disease detection algorithms. 

The data is mounted in the Udacity Jupyter GPU workspace provided to you, along with code to load the data. Alternatively, you can download the data from the [kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/nih-chest-xrays/data) and run it locally. You are STRONGLY recommended to complete the project using the Udacity workspace since the data is huge, and you will need GPU to accelerate the training process.

There are 112,120 X-ray images with disease labels from 30,805 unique patients in this dataset.  The disease labels were created using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to mine the associated radiological reports. The labels include 14 common thoracic pathologies: 
- Atelectasis 
- Consolidation
- Infiltration
- Pneumothorax
- Edema
- Emphysema
- Fibrosis
- Effusion
- Pneumonia
- Pleural thickening
- Cardiomegaly
- Nodule
- Mass
- Hernia 

The biggest limitation of this dataset is that image labels were NLP-extracted so there could be some erroneous labels but the NLP labeling accuracy is estimated to be >90%.

The original radiology reports are not publicly available but you can find more details on the labeling process [here.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02315)
